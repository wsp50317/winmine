# Project Title
The name of the project is Winnmine.This is my special topic for Network Programming courses.
You can link to others and you need to cooperate to clean the mine.

(But it just can link to the difficient ports in the same computer now,and the project is for pratice.)


## Getting Started

Open the cmd ,compile the Server.java and execute it.Then compile the Client.java and execute it.

1.You can link to the server after you input the port when you are clients.
This is initail view for clients.
